# Fitness-Workout-Video-Management-System
earn money while they workout with proper form. The job is to train in front of a camera and send us the recorded videos.
The recorded videos must follow our instructions guidelines. They only be used for artificial intelligence training, thus never be used nor shared for any other purpose.
------------
Automate the process of managing video submissions for an AI training task where individuals record workout videos based on given guidelines. However, the task you're describing seems to involve video recording, submission, and processing, which typically cannot be entirely handled with Python code alone (i.e., physical activity and video recording must be done by humans). But I can help you create a Python program for managing the video submissions, providing reminders for video recording, ensuring guidelines are followed, and perhaps even analyzing submitted videos.

Hereâ€™s a sample Python script that:

    Manages video submission from users (record and upload).
    Sends reminders and instructions.
    Verifies if the videos follow guidelines (can be extended for more advanced verification).

Step 1: Install Required Libraries

You will need some libraries for handling email communication and video uploads. Install them using pip.

pip install smtplib Flask opencv-python

Step 2: Create a Flask App for Video Submission

This small Flask app can be used to manage video uploads and track submissions.

from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Directory where videos will be uploaded
UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploaded_videos'
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

# Template for the upload page
UPLOAD_FORM = '''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Upload Your Workout Video</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Submit Your Workout Video</h1>
        <p>Please upload a video following the workout guidelines.</p>
        <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <label for="file">Select Video File:</label><br>
            <input type="file" id="file" name="file" accept="video/*" required><br><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Upload Video">
        </form>
        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The video must be in accordance with the workout form guidelines. Videos will be used for AI training only!</p>
    </body>
    </html>
'''

# Define route to upload videos
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_video():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get video file from the form
        video_file = request.files['file']
        
        # Save the video to the upload folder
        video_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], video_file.filename)
        video_file.save(video_path)
        
        # Send confirmation email or process submission further
        return f"Video '{video_file.filename}' uploaded successfully!"
    return render_template_string(UPLOAD_FORM)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Flask App:

    Flask Setup: A simple Flask web app that allows users to upload workout videos.
    Upload Directory: All uploaded videos are saved in a folder named uploaded_videos.
    Video Upload Form: The user is prompted to upload a video, which is saved on the server.
    Reminder & Instructions: Simple text is displayed on the webpage for instructions.
    Basic Video Validation: In this script, we simply save the video. You can extend it by verifying file types, size limits, and implementing video analysis using libraries like OpenCV or machine learning models to check the video quality and adherence to guidelines.

Step 3: Send Email Reminders (Optional)

You can set up an email reminder system that sends emails to users with guidelines or reminders. Below is a simple script for sending email reminders.

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email(recipient_email, subject, body):
    sender_email = "youremail@example.com"
    sender_password = "yourpassword"
    
    # Setup the MIME
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = recipient_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    # Add body to email
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    
    # Send the email
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
            text = msg.as_string()
            server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, text)
        print("Email sent successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {e}")

# Send reminder
def send_reminder():
    recipient = "user@example.com"
    subject = "Reminder to Upload Your Workout Video"
    body = """Hello,
    
We would like to remind you to upload your workout video for AI training. Remember to follow the workout form guidelines strictly. 

The payment is $8 for 40 minutes of training.

Please upload the video through the provided portal.
    
Thank you!"""
    send_email(recipient, subject, body)

send_reminder()

Explanation:

    Email Setup: This function uses SMTP to send an email. You'll need to set up your SMTP server settings based on the email provider you use (in the example, we use Gmail).
    Sending Reminders: You can send reminders to users to submit their videos.

Step 4: Advanced Video Analysis (Optional)

You may want to analyze the workout videos to ensure they are correct. Here's an idea of how to analyze videos using OpenCV, though the actual form validation requires a more sophisticated approach (like pose estimation or using AI models).

import cv2

def analyze_video(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    
    # Ensure the video was opened
    if not cap.isOpened():
        print("Error opening video stream or file")
        return False
    
    frame_count = 0
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        frame_count += 1
        
        # Process the frame (this could be where you analyze the form)
        # For example: detect poses, check movements, etc.

        # Here, we simply show the frame
        cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
        
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    return frame_count > 0  # Example check if video has frames

# Call the function with a test video
analyze_video("uploaded_videos/test_video.mp4")

Explanation:

    OpenCV Video Analysis: This function loads a video and processes each frame.
    Pose Estimation/Workout Analysis: You can extend this by using libraries like OpenPose or MediaPipe to track the quality of the workout form (e.g., checking for correct posture or movement).

Step 5: Final Thoughts and Improvements

    Video Guidelines: You can refine the video validation by adding more complex AI models that analyze specific workout movements, posture, or gestures. You could use pre-trained models or deep learning-based pose estimation systems like OpenPose or MediaPipe.
    Monetary System: For payment integration, you could use Stripe or PayPal to automate payments for completed video submissions.
    Scalability: For more users, you may need to deploy this application on a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud to handle traffic and storage.

By combining these components, you can create a system where users upload videos, and the system processes them for AI training, ensures quality, and potentially validates their workout form.
